> A fork of [pgn-to-gif]() with additional features.

First we scraped games from every Grandmaster World Championship from last 100 years

Changes we made:

- Game pieces now use an open-source library `li-chess open source pieces`(TODO find this) so we can swap them out for any style pieces.
- Overall speed improvements
- Output is transformed to JSON, rather than only plaintext.

## Install

```sh

```

## Usage
